# Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have demonstrated how to combine some built-in Slint elements with C++ code to build a little
game. There are many more features that we have not talked about, such as layouts, widgets, or styling. Have a look
at the [examples](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/tree/master/examples) in the Slint repo to
see how these look like and can be used, such as the [todo example](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/tree/master/examples/todo).

A slightly more polished version of this memory puzzle game is [available in the Slint repository](
https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/tree/master/examples/memory). And you can <a href="https://slint-ui.com/demos/memory/" target="_blank">play the wasm version</a> in your browser.
