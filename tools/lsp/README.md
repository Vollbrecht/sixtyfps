# LSP (Language Server Protocol) Server for Slint

This directory contains the implementation of the LSP server for [Slint](https://slint-ui.com)
featuring diagnostics, code
completion, goto definition, and more importantly, live-preview

## Generic usage

The LSP server consists of a binary, `slint-lsp` (or `slint-lsp.exe` on Windows). It provides all the functionality and allows any programming editor that also implements the standardized LSP protocol to communicate with it.



If you have Rust installed, you can install the binary by running the following command:

```sh
cargo install slint-lsp
```

This makes the latest released version available in `$HOME/.cargo/bin`. If you would like to try a development version, you can also point `cargo install` to the git repository:
for the released version. Or, to install the develoment version:

```sh
cargo install slint-lsp --git https://github.com/slint-ui/slint --force
```


Alternatively, you can download one of our pre-built binaries for Linux or Windows:

1. Open <https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/releases>
2. Click on the latest release
3. From "Assets" download either `slint-lsp-linux.tar.gz` for a Linux x86-64 binary
   or `slint-lsp-windows.zip` for a Windows x86-64 binary.
4. Uncompress the downloaded archive into a location of your choice.

As the next step, configure your editor to use the binary, no arguments are required

Bellow is a list of editors which have been tested.

## Usage with Visual Studio Code

For VSCode, we have an [extension in this repository](../../vscode_extension), you can install it
directly from the market place.

## Kate

### Syntax Highlighting

Kate relies on the presence of syntax highlighting file for the usage of the LSP so we'll setup
that first.
The file [slint.ksyntaxhighlighter.xml](./slint.ksyntaxhighlighter.xml) needs to be copied
in a location where kate can find it. See the [kate documentation](https://docs.kde.org/stable5/en/kate/katepart/highlight.html#katehighlight-xml-format)

On Linux, this can be done by running this command

```
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/org.kde.syntax-highlighting/syntax/
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slint-ui/slint/master/tools/lsp/slint.ksyntaxhighlighter.xml -O ~/.local/share/org.kde.syntax-highlighting/syntax/slint.xml
```

On Windows, download [slint.ksyntaxhighlighter.xml](./slint.ksyntaxhighlighter.xml) in `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\org.kde.syntax-highlighting\syntax`


### LSP

To setup the LSP, install the slint-lsp binary as explained in the [generic usage](#generic-usage) section

```
cargo install slint-lsp
```

Then go to *Settings > Configure Kate*. In the *Plugins* section, enable the *LSP-Client* plugin.
This will add a *LSP Client* section in the settings dialog. In that *LSP Client* section,
go to the *User Server Settings*, and  enter the following in the text area:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "Slint": {
      "path": ["%{ENV:HOME}/.cargo/bin", "%{ENV:USERPROFILE}/.cargo/bin"],
      "command": ["slint-lsp"],
      "highlightingModeRegex": "Slint"
    }
  }
}
```

To show the preview, right click on the name definition of the component you want to preview 
(eg. `MainWindow` in `MainWindow := Window {`). Then in the menu, select *LSP Client > Code Action > Show Preview*.


## QtCreator

To setup the lsp:
 1. Install the `slint-lsp` binary with `cargo install` as explained in the [generic usage section above](#generic-usage).
 2. Then in Qt creator, go to *Tools > Option* and select the *Language Client* section.
 3. Click *Add*
 4. As a name, use "Slint"
 5. use `*.slint` as a file pattern. (don't use MIME types)
 6. As executable, select the `~/.cargo/bin/slint-lsp` binary (no arguments required)
 7. Click *Apply* or *Ok*

In order to **preview a component**, when you have a .slint file open, place your cursor to
the name of the component you would like to preview and press *Alt + Enter* to open
the code action menu. Select *Show Preview* from that menu.

For the **syntax highlighting**, QtCreator supports the same format as Kate, with
the [xml file](./slint.ksyntaxhighlighter.xml) at the same location.
Refer to the instruction from the [previous section](#syntax-highlighting) to enable syntax highlighting.

## Vim

Vim and neovim support the Language Server Protocol via different plugins. We recommend the
[Conquer of Completion](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) plugin. Together with the
Slint LSP server, this enables inline diagnostics and code completion when editing `.slint`
files.

After installing the extension, for example via [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug),
two additional configuration changes are needed to integrate the LSP server with vim:

1. Make vim recognize the `.slint` files with the correct file type

In your vim configuration file (for example `~/.vimrc`) add the following to enable the
automatic recognition when opening `.slint` files:

```
autocmd BufEnter *.slint :setlocal filetype=slint
```

2. Configure Conquer of Completion to use the Slint LSP server

Start `vim` and run the `:CocConfig` command to bring up the buffer that allows editing
the JSON configuration file (`coc-settings.json`), and make sure the following mapping
exists under the `language` server section:

```json
{
  "languageserver": {
    "slint": {
      "command": "slint-lsp",
      "filetypes": ["slint"]
    }
  }
}
```

At the time of writting this plugin was not updated to .slint yet!

### Neovim

At the time of writing this information was not updated to slint yet!

## Sublime Text

To setup the LSP:
1. Install the slint-lsp binary with `cargo install` as explained in the *Generic Usage* section above.
2. Using Package Control in Sublime Text, install the LSP package (sublimelsp/LSP)
3. Download the Slint syntax highlighting files into your User Package folder,
   e.g. on macOS `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text/Packages/User/` :
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slint-ui/slint/master/tools/lsp/sublime/Slint.sublime-syntax
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slint-ui/slint/master/tools/lsp/sublime/Slint.tmPreferences
4. Download the LSP package settings file into your User Package folder:
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slint-ui/slint/master/tools/lsp/sublime/LSP.sublime-settings
5. Modify the slint-lsp command path in `LSP.sublime-settings` to point to the cargo instalation path in your home folder (**Replace YOUR_USER by your username**):
   `"command": ["/home/YOUR_USER/.cargo/bin/slint-lsp"]`
6. Run "LSP: Enable Language Server Globally" or "LSP: Enable Lanuage Server in Project" from Sublime's Command Palette to allow the server to start.
7. Open a .slint file - if the server starts its name will be in the left side of the status bar.

In order to **preview a component**, when you have a .slint file open, place your cursor to
the name of the component you would like to preview and select the "Show preview" button that
will appear on the right of the editor pane.
